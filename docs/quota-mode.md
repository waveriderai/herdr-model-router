# Quota mode (upstream Agent Router routing)

This is the routing mode inherited from the upstream
[agent-router](https://github.com/nidhi-singh02/agent-router) project. It ranks every
configured account and model with TypeSafe on each run, so it needs a TypeSafe API key and
every run is billed by TypeSafe. It is **opt-in**: pass `--routing-mode quota` to `router run`.
The default mode reads your role rules instead; see the [main README](../README.md) and
[Rules mode](rules.md).

The rest of this page is the upstream guide, kept for quota-mode users. Commands that route
are shown with `--routing-mode quota`.

## Why quota mode?

- **Quota-aware:** routes around depleted or reserved subscription capacity.
- **Policy-first:** deterministic eligibility rules run before semantic ranking.
- **Local-first:** configuration, usage snapshots, decisions, and session history stay on
  your machine unless an explicitly configured integration needs them.
- **Agent-agnostic:** supports Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode through one command.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or newer** (`nvm use` reads `.nvmrc`).
- **A TypeSafe API key.** Routing always calls TypeSafe; there is no fallback. Each run sends
  the task text to TypeSafe. Recognizable credentials are rejected locally before the call;
  do not place other sensitive narrative data in routing tasks.
- **At least one agent CLI you are logged in to:** `agent` (Cursor), `claude` (Claude Code),
  `codex`, or `opencode`. The router uses those logins; no provider API keys are needed.
- **Herdr**, to launch agents. `router run` without `--dry-run` only launches from inside a
  Herdr pane (`HERDR_ENV=1`).

## Setup

### 1. Install and build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/waveriderai/herdr-model-router.git
cd herdr-model-router
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Put `router` on your PATH

```sh
npm link -w @agent-router/router
```

Or add an alias to `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
alias router="node $HOME/Code/model-router/packages/router/dist/cli.js"
```

After `git pull`, run `npm run build` again.

### 3. Create your config

The config lives in `.model-router/` inside the repo (gitignored). Point the router at it
from `~/.zshrc`, then `source ~/.zshrc`:

```sh
export MODEL_ROUTER_HOME="$HOME/Code/model-router/.model-router"
```

```sh
mkdir -p .model-router
cp config.example.json .model-router/config.json
```

`MODEL_ROUTER_HOME` overrides the location on every platform. Without it the router uses the
platform config directory:

| Platform | Default home                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/model-router`                   |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/model-router`, else `~/.config/model-router` |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\model-router`                                       |

The router reads `config.json` from that directory. A missing file is treated as an empty
account list, so an unexpectedly empty `router status` usually means the home is not where you
think it is.

### 4. Store the TypeSafe key in the macOS Keychain

```sh
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s model-router-typesafe -w
```

The command prompts for the key, so it never lands in shell history. The config refers to
it with `"typesafe": { "apiKeyRef": "keychain:model-router-typesafe" }`. Every pane and agent
then finds the key without exporting anything, and it stays out of agents' environments. To
replace the key, add `-U`. If macOS asks to allow `security` access the first time, choose
"Always Allow". `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment still works as a fallback.

### 5. Add your accounts

There is no `router accounts add` command. Edit the `accounts` array in
`.model-router/config.json` (hidden folder; for example `code .model-router/config.json`) with
one entry per agent login:

```json
{
  "id": "acct_personal_claude",
  "label": "personal claude",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "ownership": "personal",
  "collectorPreference": ["local-session"],
  "enabledModels": ["anthropic:claude-sonnet", "anthropic:claude-opus"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

| Field                 | Values                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent`               | `cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `opencode`                                                 |
| `provider`            | Matches the models: `cursor`, `anthropic`, `openai`                                          |
| `ownership`           | `personal`, or `shared` for a subscription other people also use (see below)                 |
| `reserveFloor`        | Optional, 0 to 1. Shared accounts default to `0.40` and cannot go lower                      |
| `collectorPreference` | Where usage comes from: `local-session`, `official-cli`, `official-api`, `browser-dashboard` |
| `enabledModels`       | Model IDs from the table below                                                               |
| `enabled`             | `true` or `false`                                                                            |
| `credentialRef`       | Optional `env:NAME` or `keychain:NAME`. Never put secret values in the file                  |

Run `router accounts` to check that the file parses. `docs/configuration.md` has the full
schema.

### 6. Install the model-router skill (optional, recommended)

The skill lets an agent route the next phase of your work (see
[Phases](#phases-planning-then-implementation)). Link the repo copy so updates arrive with
`git pull`:

```sh
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-router" ~/.claude/skills/model-router
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-router" ~/.codex/skills/model-router
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-router" ~/.cursor/skills/model-router
```

The links follow whatever branch is checked out in this repo.

## Models

Defined in `packages/router/config/models.json`. Add an ID to an account's `enabledModels` to
use it.

| Model ID                  | Agent       | Starts as                                                        | Efforts                              | Quota pool |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `cursor:grok-4.6`         | Cursor      | `agent --model cursor-grok-4.6-<effort>`                         | low, medium, high                    | spend      |
| `cursor:grok-4.5`         | Cursor      | `agent --model cursor-grok-4.5-high`                             | high                                 | spend      |
| `cursor:composer-2.5`     | Cursor      | `agent --model composer-2.5`                                     | none                                 | auto       |
| `anthropic:claude-sonnet` | Claude Code | `claude --model sonnet --effort <effort>`                        | low, medium, high                    |            |
| `anthropic:claude-opus`   | Claude Code | `claude --model opus --effort <effort>`                          | low, medium, high, xhigh, max        |            |
| `openai:gpt-6-astra`      | Codex       | `codex --model gpt-6-astra -c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>"` | low, medium, high, xhigh, max, ultra |            |
| `openai:gpt-5.6-sol`      | Codex       | `codex --model gpt-5.6-sol …`                                    | low, medium, high, ultra             |            |
| `openai:gpt-5.6-terra`    | Codex       | `codex --model gpt-5.6-terra …`                                  | low, medium, high, ultra             |            |
| `openai:gpt-5.6-luna`     | Codex       | `codex --model gpt-5.6-luna …`                                   | low, medium, high                    |            |
| `openai:gpt-5.5`          | Codex       | `codex --model gpt-5.5 …`                                        | low, medium, high                    |            |
| `openai:opencode`         | OpenCode    | `opencode --model openai`                                        | low, medium, high                    |            |

TypeSafe picks the effort from the model's list. `max` and `ultra` are only offered when the
task you started the chain with (`router run` without `--session`) contains the word
"ultra"; continued sessions inherit that, and a continued task cannot unlock them. Capability, cost, and latency numbers in `models.json` are
estimates you can adjust.

## Everyday use

```sh
router run --routing-mode quota "<task>" --dry-run    # see which agent, model, and effort would be used
router run --routing-mode quota "<task>"              # start that agent in a new Herdr pane and send the task
router status                    # list accounts; add --usage to show quota
router session                   # the latest launch; router session --list for more
```

`--dry-run` prints the decision card and the command it would start, without opening a pane
or sending anything. A real run splits a new pane next to the current one, starts the agent,
waits for it to finish starting up, sends the task, and confirms the agent began working. You
can run the router any number of times, in the same tab or different ones; each launch gets
its own agent name such as `router-codex-3c356c`.

### The decision card

```text
Selected: cursor / composer-2.5 / none
Phase: implementation
Why: TypeSafe selected acct_personal_cursor:cursor:composer-2.5 for implementation in phase implementation
Reserve policy: personal account
Cache decision: no previous session
Usage source: estimated local-session
Quota: auto 70% left (spend 45% left)
Freshness: refreshed at 2026-09-17T12:00:00.000Z
```

The router routes **one phase per task** (planning, implementation, debugging, review,
research, and so on). It does not answer your question itself; the launched agent does.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Route selected (and launched, unless `--dry-run`)                       |
| 1    | Launch failed; the reason is printed and recorded in the session        |
| 2    | No route: no eligible model, TypeSafe unavailable, or session not found |
| 3    | Low confidence on a consequential task; choose one of the two routes    |

## Quota and usage

Usage checks on `router run` are **local-session by default**: the router reads status-line
cache files (milliseconds) and persists non-unknown snapshots to SQLite. Official CLI/API
and browser collectors stay behind `--usage` (slower, and some live commands may consume
quota). Personal accounts stay eligible when quota is missing, stale, or at 0%. Shared
accounts still need _known_ usage above the reserve.

`router status` without `--usage` still lists accounts only. `router status --usage` runs
the full collector chain.

Quota on the card is informational. For a personal account, a model at 0% remaining is
still eligible. Shared accounts still exclude `quota-exhausted` and `unknown-usage`.

### Where quota comes from

The Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex CLIs do not report plan usage on the command line. The
router reads quota from cache files that **your own status line scripts** write; the router
does not install those scripts. Enable it with `"local-session"` in the account's
`collectorPreference`. Cache data older than 15 minutes counts as unknown, and a cache only
refreshes while a session of that tool is open and redrawing its status line.

**Cursor:** `~/.cursor/statusline-quota-cache.json`

```json
{ "pct": 45, "auto_left": 70, "at": 1700000000 }
```

`pct` is the percent of included spend left (Grok models), `auto_left` the percent of the Auto
pool left (Composer), and `at` the Unix time in seconds.

**Claude Code:** `~/.claude/statusline-quota-cache.json`, written from the `rate_limits`
Claude Code passes to its status line:

```json
{
  "at": 1700000000,
  "five_hour": { "used_percentage": 20, "resets_at": 1700013600 },
  "seven_day": { "used_percentage": 10, "resets_at": 1700604800 }
}
```

Either window may be missing, and a window whose reset time has passed counts as fully
available.

**Codex:** `~/.codex/statusline-quota-cache.json`

```json
{ "weekly_left": 40, "at": 1700000000 }
```

`weekly_left` is the percent of weekly quota remaining (0–100), and `at` is Unix time in
seconds. The router does not write this file.

**OpenCode:** harness-only; quota belongs to the underlying provider.

### Personal and shared accounts

- **Personal:** stays eligible even if quota is missing, stale, or at 0%. The card may still
  show remaining quota when a cache exists.
- **Shared:** needs known usage (a fresh local-session cache, or `--usage`) and keeps 40% of
  its quota in reserve. It is excluded when the coordinator reports the account as already active.
  Without a coordinator (the usual local setup), it routes on its quota alone.

## Phases: planning, then implementation

Each `router run` records a session in `.model-router/state.sqlite`. A launched agent's task
ends with `Router session: <id>` and instructions for when its phase is done. With the skill
installed, the flow is:

The router repairs the state directory to `0700` and SQLite-related files to `0600` whenever
it opens the database. Treat the task and handoff history as sensitive local data.

1. `router run --routing-mode quota "plan feature X"` starts, for example, Grok for planning.
2. The agent writes the plan to a file and asks you whether to route the next phase.
3. When you agree, it runs `router session <id>` and
   `router run --routing-mode quota --session <id> "implement the plan in docs/plans/x.md" --dry-run`, shows you
   the card, and launches without `--dry-run` after you confirm.
4. The new session records the previous one. The card shows
   `Previous session: <id> (planning -> implementation)`, and the new agent gets the previous
   phase and task.

The next agent starts in a new pane without the earlier conversation, so the task must point
to the file. You can run the same commands yourself:

```sh
router session <id>
router run --routing-mode quota --session <id> "implement the plan in docs/plans/x.md"
```

## Isolated worktrees (`--worktree`)

By default the agent starts in the pane's current directory, as before. With `--worktree`,
the router gives the task its own Git worktree and branch first:

```sh
router run --routing-mode quota "implement feature X" --worktree --dry-run   # preview the worktree and branch
router run --routing-mode quota "implement feature X" --worktree
```

- The current directory must be inside a Git repository with at least one commit, and the
  checkout must be clean: no staged, unstaged, or untracked (non-ignored) files. A dirty
  checkout is rejected with the first few changes listed; the router never stashes, commits,
  resets, copies, or discards them.
- The router creates a new branch `router/wt-<timestamp>-<random>` from the committed `HEAD`
  and a worktree for it under `<router home>/worktrees/<repo>-<hash>/`, outside the checkout.
  Task text never appears in the branch name, the path, or any Git argument, and Git runs
  without a shell.
- The agent is launched with that worktree as its working directory (`herdr pane split
--cwd`). The router does not pass an agent's own worktree flags; it owns the workspace.
- The session records the worktree path, branch, repository (its shared `.git` directory and
  source checkout), starting commit, and that isolation is enabled. `router session` and
  `router session --json` show them.
- Checks run before any routing call, so a missing repository or a dirty checkout costs no
  TypeSafe call, reservation, or pane. The worktree itself is created only after the route
  and its reservation succeed. Immediately before that, the router reads the checkout again:
  if it became dirty, or HEAD or the repository changed while routing, the run stops, the
  reservation is released, and nothing is created. If creating the worktree fails, nothing
  is launched. If the agent then fails to start, the worktree is kept and its path is
  printed; it is never deleted automatically.
- A dry run previews the path, branch, and starting commit, and creates no branch, worktree,
  pane, session, or reservation. Unlike a plain dry run, which reserves capacity and releases
  it at once, a `--worktree` dry run checks capacity read-only. Its TypeSafe calls are the
  same.

`router run --routing-mode quota --session <id> "<next task>"` on an isolated session reuses the recorded worktree,
with or without `--worktree`: the next agent (which may be a different one) starts in that
directory, sees the previous phase's uncommitted files, and no second worktree is created.
The router confirms the directory still exists, is a worktree of the recorded repository,
and is on the recorded branch, once before routing and again immediately before the pane
opens. If either check fails it stops with the reason; it never falls back to the current
directory. When that continued task names a pull request, its size is resolved from the
recorded worktree, including when the command is started from another directory. Sessions
recorded without `--worktree` continue exactly as before.

Quota and reservations are unchanged: a worktree run is routed, reserved, and revalidated
against the same account pools as any other run.

The router does not merge, push, or remove worktrees. When you are done with one:

```sh
git worktree remove "<path>"      # add --force to discard uncommitted work
git branch -d router/wt-...       # or merge it first
```

## Live effort switching

Opus 5.5 and GPT 6 Astra can change reasoning effort inside a running session without
losing the conversation. With `"liveEffort": { "enabled": true }` in `config.json`, the
router uses that in two places:

- **Between phases.** When `router run --routing-mode quota --session <id>` picks the same account and model as
  the previous session, the next phase continues in the same pane at the new effort instead
  of a new pane. From inside that pane the agent is told to continue; from anywhere else the
  router waits for the pane to be idle and sends the task. The card shows
  `Continuation: in place (pane …), effort medium -> high`.
- **Within a phase.** An agent runs
  `router effort --session <id> "<sub-step>" [--step-kind debug] [--consecutive-failures 3] …`
  when a sub-step is markedly harder or easier. TypeSafe picks the level from the sub-step,
  the phase, the current level, and the bucketed signals; it never sees the conversation.

You can switch by hand with `router effort <id> <level>`. That manual form is refused when
run from inside an agent (Claude Code or Codex); an agent can only use the `--session` form,
only for its own pane, and with a sub-step of one plain-text line up to 500 characters.

How each agent is switched:

| Agent                  | How                                                                                   | Takes effect                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code (Opus 5.5) | `/effort` slider, then `s` ("this session only"); your saved default is never changed | Next request, even mid-turn                                                     |
| Codex (Astra)          | `Alt+.` / `Alt+,` steps; not saved                                                    | Next turn: the router queues the continuation (Tab) and the agent ends its turn |

Rules:

- Switches in place stay between `low` and `xhigh`. `max` and `ultra` start only with a new
  pane, on both models.
- An agent switch needs TypeSafe confidence of at least 0.6, at least 5 minutes since the
  previous one, and at most 8 per session. Raising effort re-checks the account's quota and
  shared reserve; lowering is always allowed.
- The router never types over text in the input box, never confirms a dialog, and confirms
  every switch on screen. If Claude shows its "Change effort level?" cache warning (Bedrock
  and gateways), the router picks "No, go back" and stops switching that pane.
- Codex Plan mode, a blocked pane, or a pane that changed stops the switch. Between phases,
  any failure falls back to a new pane, except when the handoff may already have reached the
  old pane: then no new pane is opened, the run exits 1, and the card names the pane to check.
- A pane at `max` or `ultra` continues in place at that level, but an agent's sub-step
  switches are skipped there (`top-tier-held`) so your choice is not lowered.
- After an in-place continuation, only the newest session id for the pane is accepted
  (`superseded-session` otherwise). `router effort` needs Herdr (`not-in-herdr` otherwise).

`router effort` exits 0 when it switched, 4 when nothing changed (for example `cooldown`,
`low-confidence`, `quota`, or `disabled`), 5 when the switch failed, 2 when the session is
unknown or has no route, and 1 on a usage error. `router session <id>` lists that session's
effort history; after an in-place continuation, earlier switches in the same pane belong to
the previous session.

## Commands

```sh
router run --routing-mode quota "<task>" [--dry-run] [--usage] [--no-enrich] [--session <id>] [--worktree] [--json]
router effort --session <id> "<sub-step>" [signal flags] [--json]
router effort <id> <level> [--json]
router status [--usage]
router session [id] [--list] [--limit <n>] [--json]
router accounts
router usage refresh [--source local-session|official-cli|browser] [--dry-run]
```

`--json` prints machine-readable output for plugins, including `sessionId`, `agentName`, and
`paneId`, plus `workspace` for `--worktree` runs and continued isolated sessions. With live
effort switching on, `router run --routing-mode quota --session --json` adds `continuation`: `{mode: "in-place",
from, to, turnBreak}` (plus `dryRun: true` on a dry run) or `{mode: "new-pane", reason}`.
`router session <id> --json` includes an `effortChanges` array. `router effort --json` prints
`{ok, sessionId, from, to, status, reason, turnBreak}`, where `ok` is true only when the pane
switched; for exit 2 it prints `{ok: false, sessionId, status: "failed", reason, error}` with
`reason` `unknown-session` or `no-route`. When the calling agent continues in its own pane, `continuation` also carries
`self: true` and the `handoff` text; an unconfirmed handoff adds `unconfirmed: true`. When a task names a pull request, `--no-enrich` skips resolving its size through
GitHub. Set `enrichment.enabled` to `false` in `config.json` to disable that resolution by
default. `router usage refresh` defaults to local-session file reads; `--dry-run` prints facts
and does not persist. Without `--dry-run` it writes snapshots to SQLite.

## Herdr plugin

The router also ships as a Herdr plugin, so routing, status, sessions, and usage refresh are
reachable from Herdr actions and keybindings instead of a shell prompt:

```sh
herdr plugin install waveriderai/herdr-model-router
herdr plugin action list --plugin waveriderai.herdr-model-router
```

The manifest is `herdr-plugin.toml` at the repository root; the scripts it runs live in
`herdr-plugin/`. See [`herdr-plugin/README.md`](../herdr-plugin/README.md) for the action list,

## Development

```sh
npm run verify   # typecheck, lint, format check, tests, build
npm test         # tests only
```

Do not deploy the Cloudflare coordinator (`packages/coordinator`) or write into an external
Hermes checkout (`packages/hermes-heartbeat`) without explicit approval. See `docs/` for
configuration, operations, privacy, and provider support.

## Security and privacy

- Never commit `.model-router/`, `.env`, API keys, bearer tokens, cookies, or provider cache
  files. The repository ignores the local state directories and environment files by default.
- Store the TypeSafe key in the macOS Keychain as shown above. Environment variables are a
  supported fallback, but are easier to expose accidentally through child processes or logs.
- Task text is sent to TypeSafe for classification and ranking. Do not route secrets,
  credentials, private client data, or other sensitive text.
- `router run` starts local agent processes with the permissions of your current user. Review
  the selected route and task before launching it.
- The optional coordinator and heartbeat packages are not required for ordinary personal
  accounts. Treat them as pre-release components and review their deployment configuration
  before exposing them to a network.

See [Privacy](privacy.md), [Operations](operations.md), and
[Configuration](configuration.md) for the detailed data flow and deployment guidance.
