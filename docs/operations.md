# Operations

## Dry run

```sh
router usage refresh --dry-run
router usage refresh --source browser --dry-run
router run "<task>" --dry-run
```

`router usage refresh --dry-run` collects the selected source (default `local-session`) and
prints one line per account; it does not write SQLite. Omit `--dry-run` to persist.
`router run --dry-run` prints a redacted decision and does not create a Herdr pane.
`router run --worktree --dry-run` also previews the worktree path, branch, and starting commit.
It checks that the checkout is a clean Git repository but creates no branch, worktree, pane,
session, or reservation (capacity is checked read-only).

## Worktrees

`router run --worktree` creates worktrees under `<router home>/worktrees/` and never removes
them. List and clean them up with Git from the source checkout:

```sh
git worktree list
git worktree remove "<path>"   # refuses if the worktree has uncommitted changes
git worktree prune             # forget worktrees whose directory was deleted by hand
```

A continued isolated session (`router run --session <id>`) whose worktree was removed, moved,
switched to another branch, or re-pointed at another repository stops with an error instead of
launching elsewhere. That check runs again after routing, immediately before the pane opens.
Pull request size for a continued session is read from the worktree. Start a new `--worktree`
run when the recorded workspace is no longer usable.

If the source checkout changes while a new `--worktree` run is routing (new commit, or
uncommitted files), the router does not create the worktree. Commit or clean up, then retry.

## Coordinator workflow

Schema version 5 adds `worktree_bindings`, `workflows`, `workflow_attempts`,
`workflow_verifications`, `workflow_verifier_results`, and `workflow_intents`, and the bound
`session_id` and `session_cwd` of each writer lane. Existing tasks are kept; a writer task from
before version 5 has no bound session, so it cannot take revisions or join a workflow.

The router home must be outside the checkouts it writes for: `workflow`, `task`, and rules-mode
launches, and real quota-mode runs, refuse a `MODEL_ROUTER_HOME` inside the target checkout (compared by real path, so a
symlink alias counts) before creating any state.

`router workflow status <id>` prints the commands that can make progress now. After an
interruption:

- Attempt `unknown` or `sending` (standalone): inspect the writer's pane, then
  `router workflow recover <id> --delivered|--not-delivered --evidence "..."`. Nothing is
  resent. A confirmed non-delivery is ended with `workflow release <id> --abort`.
- agent-collab: `router workflow recover <id>` reads `agent-collab status --run`. A lost
  `acquire` answer is manual recovery through `agent-collab recover --worktree <path>`; HMR
  never acquires twice.
- `release` and `release --abort` refuse unless Herdr reports the bound writer idle or done
  with its exact session. If the writer is gone and Herdr cannot confirm it, the workflow stays
  open; inspect the pane rather than forcing a release.
- `operation-in-progress`: another coordinator step holds the workflow. A step whose process
  died is taken over by the next one on the same host; on another host it stays until that
  host's step ends.
- An unresolved agent-collab call (`intent-unresolved`, `backend-unknown`) blocks the
  workflow's other external calls until `workflow recover` reconciles it from status.
- A start whose new pane could not be confirmed closed keeps the worktree (`unknown`):
  inspect that pane. A start that rolled back cleanly is `failed` and holds nothing.

The router refuses to change a worktree's binding while any workflow is open or a writer task owns it.

## Live effort switching

Off unless `liveEffort.enabled` is `true` (see [Configuration](configuration.md)). Schema
version 3 adds two SQLite tables to the router state database:

- `effort_changes`: one row per switch attempt (applied, no-change, or failed) with source
  (`agent`, `manual`, `phase-boundary`), from/to effort, an outcome code, TypeSafe confidence,
  and the bucketed signals. `router session <id>` shows a session's rows.
- `effort_locks`: one lock per Herdr pane, so two callers never type into the same pane. A
  `router effort` lock lasts about 200 s and an in-place continuation lock about 120 s; a lock
  left by a crashed process expires on its own and is cleared by the next caller. While a
  lock is held, an agent's `router effort` fails fast (exit 5 `switch-in-progress`) and the
  manual form waits up to 10 s.

Sessions may now record `xhigh` or `max`, which older router builds cannot read. After using
them, do not point an older build at the same state directory.

A switch drives each agent's TUI and was verified against Claude Code 2.1.283 and codex-cli
0.156.1. After upgrading either CLI, rerun the manual checklist in
[`validation/2026-09-26-live-effort-smoke.md`](validation/2026-09-26-live-effort-smoke.md)
before relying on it; screen text the router does not recognize stops the switch rather than
typing into the pane.

## Coordinator

Local Worker tests cover create/renew/status/release. Do not `wrangler deploy` until the
Cloudflare account and environment are approved. Apply D1 migrations locally only:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply model-router-leases --local
```

The Worker uses D1 for state; a missing binding returns `503`. Remote coordinator URLs
must use HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback development hosts.

## Hermes hook

See `packages/hermes-heartbeat/README.md`. Do not modify an external Hermes checkout
until its path and ownership are confirmed.

## Dashboard fallback

Requires an explicitly attached authenticated browser session. Cookie databases are
never copied into router storage.

## Recovery

Launch tokens and pane IDs make retries skip a second `herdr pane split`. Blocked
agents are reported; the handoff is not blindly resent. Heartbeat TTLs expire remote
leases after a crash. Each provider operation owns a unique lease, renews it while the
operation runs, and releases only that lease. Local capacity reservations are acquired
atomically in SQLite so competing router processes cannot both consume the same reserve.

## TypeSafe

Live `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` calls are opt-in. Default tests use a fake client. A local
`router run --dry-run` without that key reports `typesafe-unavailable` rather than
inventing a semantic ranking. Task text containing a recognized credential is rejected
locally with a sanitized error before any TypeSafe request.
