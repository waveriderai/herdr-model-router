# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The `router`, `hermes-heartbeat`, and `coordinator` packages are versioned together
and released under a single tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Rules mode, now the default for `router run`: routes an explicit `--role` from a
  `pstack-models.mdc` role table (`--rules`, the project's `.model-router/` or `.cursor/rules/`,
  then `~/.cursor/rules/`). New `roles` and `plan` commands and rules-mode `run --dry-run` read
  files only. Lanes use `provider:model@effort` with exact native model ids; the legacy
  `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` selector maps to native `grok:grok-4.7@xhigh`. Panels launch every
  lane read-only; writer tasks own their worktree, take revisions in the same pane, and close
  only with evidence (`task status|revise|complete|release|recover`). Prompt attempts are
  recorded and never resent while their outcome is unknown.
- Project policy in `.model-router/policy.json`: allowed providers, exact pins, writer roles.
- Native grok CLI support (Herdr kind `grok`), with read-only modes enforced per provider.
- Native CLIs start in their pane through `/usr/bin/env -i` with a short variable allowlist
  read from that pane's shell, so provider API keys and cloud credentials exported by shell rc
  files never reach them. Herdr must detect the expected agent kind before the router names or
  prompts it.
- A readiness check before every prompt and revision: the lane pane's screen must show the
  CLI's ordinary input prompt, and workspace-trust, login, update, permission and confirmation
  dialogs are refused without input. OpenCode is not launched until it has verified
  ready-prompt evidence.
- `hmr` as a second name for the CLI; `NOTICE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, issue and pull request templates, and a GitHub `verify` workflow.
- Coordinator workflows (`router workflow plan|start|status|result|verify|revise|accept|delivery|release|recover|fingerprint|bind`):
  one writer per worktree, read-only verifier panels, and explicit result, acceptance,
  delivery, and release steps. Briefs and results are versioned JSON (`hmr.brief/v1`,
  `hmr.result/v1`) tied to a workflow, an attempt, and an exact worktree revision (HEAD plus a
  fingerprint of tracked and non-ignored untracked files). Verification, acceptance, and
  release need the bound writer (name, kind, pane, native session, and directory) reported idle
  or done. Every verifier lane must pass, and a Git delivery is checked against the commit's own
  tree. `--parent` resolves parent aliases for the whole workflow. The `model-router` skill
  gains the coordinator procedure (`references/workflow.md`), and `examples/workflow/` holds
  synthetic briefs and results.
- An optional writer authority per worktree: the router's own lease (`standalone`, the
  default) or the external `agent-collab` CLI, chosen with `router workflow bind` and followed
  by every writer entrance. With agent-collab, the router runs its read-only `verify` and
  `project` preflight, requires the writer's exact model to match that project's policy, starts
  the native CLI itself, and lets agent-collab send the single prompt. The router keeps the
  owner capability in a private file and never in its database, JSON output, or prompts.
- Recovery without replay. Each prompt is sent at most once. Each external call is recorded
  before it runs and finishes in the same database transaction as the router's own change.
  `router workflow recover` settles an interrupted call from read-only backend status, and only
  when that status names the exact run, native session, pane, and attempt.

### Changed

- A real quota-mode `router run` now takes the worktree's writer authority before it sends the
  handoff and keeps it for the writer's whole run. The output names the writer task; end it with
  `router task complete` or `router task release --stopped`. `--session` continuing the same
  chain in the same worktree keeps the task. The task is given back only when no input can have
  reached an agent. A handoff with an unknown outcome keeps the worktree, is recorded as an
  `unknown` attempt, and is never resent. Use `--worktree` to run several quota agents at once.
- Rules-mode writer lanes record the native session, directory, and agent name before their
  first prompt, and `task revise` checks all of them. A writer task recorded before this change
  has no recorded session, so it cannot take revisions. A writer whose Herdr integration
  reports no session is not started.
- `task revise|complete|release|recover` refuse tasks that belong to an open workflow.
  Workflow, task, rules-mode, and real quota-mode commands refuse a `MODEL_ROUTER_HOME` inside
  the target checkout.
- `router run` without `--routing-mode` no longer calls TypeSafe. The upstream ranking is
  `--routing-mode quota`; `--session`, `--worktree`, `--usage`, and `--no-enrich` require it.
  `--routing-mode semantic` lets TypeSafe pick a role from the rules file for one run.
- `npm run verify` builds the heartbeat package first, so it passes from a clean checkout.
- The supported Node.js floor is now 22.12 (`engines`, `.nvmrc`, docs, plugin manifest), and
  CI runs Node 22 and 24 on Ubuntu and macOS. The previous `>=20` claim (and the first CI's
  Node 20 jobs) contradicted the locked dependencies: `better-sqlite3` 13 requires Node 22,
  `commander` 15 requires 22.12, and Vitest 5 requires 22.12+. On Node 20, `npm ci` warns
  `EBADENGINE` for six packages and `better-sqlite3` segfaults on its first database call, which
  crashed every SQLite-backed test worker.

- Live effort switching for Opus 5.5 and GPT 6 Astra, opt-in with `liveEffort.enabled`.
  `router run --session <id>` continues the next phase in the previous pane when TypeSafe
  picks the same account and model, changing the effort in place instead of opening a new
  pane. `router effort --session <id> "<sub-step>"` lets an agent ask TypeSafe for a new
  level mid-phase, with a cooldown, a per-session cap, a confidence floor, and a quota
  recheck before raising effort; `router effort <id> <level>` is the manual override.
  Claude Code switches through its `/effort` slider with "this session only", so the saved
  default is never changed; Codex switches with its reasoning shortcut, which applies from
  the next turn, so the continuation is queued for that turn. Every switch is confirmed on
  screen and recorded in a new `effort_changes` table, shown by `router session`. An agent
  can switch only its own pane, its sub-step must be one line of plain text, and the manual
  form is refused inside an agent.
- Opus 5.5 gains `xhigh` and `max`; GPT 6 Astra gains `xhigh` and `max`.
- `router --version` (and `-V`) reports the package version.
- `router run --worktree` launches the agent in a new Git worktree and branch created from
  the committed `HEAD` of a clean checkout, outside the checkout. The session records the
  worktree path, branch, repository identity, and starting commit; `router session` and its
  `--json` output show them. `router run --session <id>` on an isolated session reuses and
  validates that worktree instead of the current directory, both before routing and again
  immediately before launch. If the source checkout becomes dirty or HEAD changes while
  routing, creation stops and the reservation is released. A continued isolated session
  resolves pull request size from its worktree. `--worktree --dry-run` previews the
  worktree without creating anything. Runs without `--worktree` are unchanged.

### Changed

- `max` and `ultra` are unlocked only by the word "ultra" in the root `router run` task,
  and the unlock is inherited by continued sessions. Previously any task, including a
  continued one an agent wrote, could unlock `ultra`; a next-phase task typed into the Herdr
  plugin's resume prompt no longer unlocks it either.
- The state database moves to schema version 3 (`effort_changes`, `effort_locks`). Sessions
  may now record `xhigh` or `max`, which older router builds cannot read: after using them,
  do not run an older build against the same state directory.
- Renamed the npm scope from `@model-router/*` to `@agent-router/*` to match the
  repository name. Nothing was published under the old scope; a local checkout
  needs `npm install` and a re-run of `npm link -w @agent-router/router`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-18

Initial public release. Pre-release software: the routing, quota, and account
contracts may still change.

### Added

- `router run`, `status`, `session`, `accounts`, and `usage refresh` commands.
- Deterministic eligibility filtering over configured subscriptions: enabled
  models, authentication, usage certainty, quota exhaustion, and the 40% reserve
  floor on shared accounts.
- TypeSafe ranking and reasoning-effort selection over the eligible candidate set
  only, with a privacy gate that rejects credential-shaped state before any call.
- Usage collectors for Cursor, Claude, Codex, and OpenCode, with local-session
  status-line caches by default and slower CLI/browser collectors behind `--usage`.
- Phase-sticky routing: sessions recorded in SQLite, phase transitions from
  planning to implementation, and structured handoff to the launched agent.
- Agent launch into a separate Herdr pane, with launch tokens and pane IDs that
  prevent duplicate panes on retry, plus handoff delivery confirmation.
- Hosted heartbeat coordinator (Cloudflare Workers/D1) and a heartbeat client for
  reporting shared-account activity without transmitting identities or task content.
- Herdr plugin manifest and actions.
- Documentation: configuration, operations, privacy, and provider support.

### Known limitations

- The CLI does not yet report its own version (`router --version` is unsupported).
- The coordinator is not deployed; without it, shared accounts route on quota alone.
